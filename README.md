Question 1
Write a function factorial that takes a number as argument and returns it’s factorial.
Hint: Factorial(x) = x * ( x - 1 ) *( x - 2 )...*1
Question 2
Rewrite the solution to the problem in Question 2 using recursion.
Question 3
Write a function that prints out the numbers 123456789987654321.
Question 4
Rewrite the solution to the problem in Question 4 using recursion.
Question 5
Write a function that takes an integer n as parameter and returns the number of digits in that number e.g. n=512364 should return 6.
Question 6
Rewrite the solution to the problem in Question 6 using recursion.
Question 7
Write a function that receives an integer n as argument and returns the number of ones (1s) in the binary representation of n.
Question 8
Rewrite the solution to the problem in Question 8 using recursion.
Question 9
A palindrome is a string that is spelled the same way forward and backward. Some examples of palindromes are "radar” and “madam” etc. Write a function that input a string str and check whether its palindrome or not.
Hint: function will receive three arguments, i.e. isPalindrome (char *str, int s, int l)
Question 10
Rewrite the solution to the problem in Question 11 using recursion.
Hint: function will receive three arguments, i.e. isPalindrome (char *str, int s, int l)
Question 11
Write the reverse function recursively. This function takes a string and the length of the string as arguments and returns the same string with its characters in the reverse order.
Hint: Reverse (string s,int length);
